Modern UIs are rarely static. The state of the UI changes when the user
interacts with the UI or when the app needs to display new data.

This document prescribes guidelines for the production and management of UI
state. It is meant to help you understand the following:

- What APIs to use to produce UI state. This depends on the nature of the sources of state change available in your state holders, following [unidirectional data flow](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#udf) principles.
- How to scope the production of UI state to be conscious of system resources.
- How to expose the UI state for consumption by the UI.

Fundamentally, state production is the incremental application of these changes
to the UI state. State always exists, and it changes as a result of events. The
differences between events and state are summarized in the table below:

| Events | State |
|---|---|
| Transient, unpredictable, and exist for a finite period. | Always exists. |
| The inputs of state production. | The output of state production. |
| The product of the UI or other sources. | Is consumed by the UI. |

A great mnemonic that summarizes the above is **state is; events happen** . The
diagram below helps visualize changes to state as events occur in a timeline.
Each event is processed by the appropriate [state holder](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/stateholders) and it results in a
state change:
![Events vs. state](https://developer.android.com/static/images/topic/architecture/ui-layer/events-vs-state.png) **Figure 1**: Events cause state to change

Events can come from the following:

- **Users**: As they interact with the app's UI.
- **Other sources of state change**: APIs that present app data from UI, domain, or data layers like Snackbar timeout events, use cases, or repositories, respectively.

## The UI state production pipeline

State production in Android apps can be thought of as a processing pipeline
comprising the following:

- **Inputs** : The sources of state change. They can be:
  - Local to the UI layer: These might be user events like a user entering a title for a "to-do" in a task management app, or APIs that provide access to [UI logic](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/stateholders#ui-logic) that drives changes in UI state---for example, calling the [`open`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/DrawerState#open()) method on [`DrawerState`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/DrawerState) in Jetpack Compose.
  - External to the UI layer: These are sources from the domain or data layers that cause changes to UI state---for example, news that finished loading from a `NewsRepository` or other events.
  - A mixture of the above.
- [**State holders**](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/stateholders): Types that apply [business logic](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/stateholders#business-logic) and [UI
  logic](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/stateholders#ui-logic) to sources of state change, and that process user events to produce UI state.
- **Output**: The UI State that the app can render to provide users the information they need.

![The state production pipeline](https://developer.android.com/static/images/topic/architecture/ui-layer/state-production-pipeline.png) **Figure 2**: The state production pipeline

## State production APIs

There are two main APIs used in state production depending on what stage of the
pipeline you're in:

| Pipeline stage | API |
|---|---|
| Input | Use asynchronous APIs like Coroutines and Flows to perform work off the UI thread to keep the UI jank-free. |
| Output | Use observable data holder APIs like Compose State or StateFlow to invalidate and re-render the UI when state changes. Observable data holders ensure that the UI always has a UI state to display on the screen. |

The choice of asynchronous API for input has a greater influence on the nature
of the state production pipeline than the choice of observable API for output.
This is because the inputs **dictate the kind of processing that can be applied
to the pipeline**.

## State production pipeline assembly

The next sections cover state production techniques best suited for various
inputs, and the output APIs that match. Each state production pipeline is a
combination of inputs and outputs and must be the following:

- **Lifecycle aware**: In the case where the UI is not visible or active, the state production pipeline must not consume any resources unless explicitly required.
- **Easy to consume**: The UI must be able to easily render the produced UI state. In Jetpack Compose, state consumption is central to the UI, because composables can update based on state changes.

## Inputs in state production pipelines

Inputs in a state production pipeline provide their sources of state change
through the following:

- One-shot operations that can be synchronous or asynchronous---for example, calls to `suspend` functions.
- Stream APIs---for example, `Flows`.
- All of the above.

The following sections cover how you can assemble a state production pipeline
for each of the above inputs.

### One-shot APIs as sources of state change

Manage state with observable data holders. Use the [`mutableStateOf`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/package-summary#mutableStateOf(kotlin.Any,androidx.compose.runtime.SnapshotMutationPolicy)) API,
especially when working with [Compose text APIs](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/effective-state-management-for-textfield-in-compose-d6e5b070fbe5). For more complex state
management or when integrating with other architectural components, use the
[`MutableStateFlow`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-mutable-state-flow/) API. Both APIs offer methods that allow safe atomic
updates to the values they host, whether the updates are synchronous or
asynchronous.

For example, consider state updates in a simple dice-rolling app. Each roll of
the dice from the user invokes the synchronous [`Random.nextInt`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.random/next-int.html) method,
and the result is written into the UI state.

### Compose State

    @Stable
    interface DiceUiState {
        val firstDieValue: Int?
        val secondDieValue: Int?
        val numberOfRolls: Int?
    }

    private class MutableDiceUiState: DiceUiState {
        override var firstDieValue: Int? by mutableStateOf(null)
        override var secondDieValue: Int? by mutableStateOf(null)
        override var numberOfRolls: Int by mutableStateOf(0)
    }

    class DiceRollViewModel : ViewModel() {

        private val _uiState = MutableDiceUiState()
        val uiState: DiceUiState = _uiState

        // Called from the UI
        fun rollDice() {
            _uiState.firstDieValue = Random.nextInt(from = 1, until = 7)
            _uiState.secondDieValue = Random.nextInt(from = 1, until = 7)
            _uiState.numberOfRolls = _uiState.numberOfRolls + 1
        }
    }

### StateFlow

    data class DiceUiState(
        val firstDieValue: Int? = null,
        val secondDieValue: Int? = null,
        val numberOfRolls: Int = 0,
    )

    class DiceRollViewModel : ViewModel() {

        private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(DiceUiState())
        val uiState: StateFlow<DiceUiState> = _uiState.asStateFlow()

        // Called from the UI
        fun rollDice() {
            _uiState.update { currentState ->
                currentState.copy(
                firstDieValue = Random.nextInt(from = 1, until = 7),
                secondDieValue = Random.nextInt(from = 1, until = 7),
                numberOfRolls = currentState.numberOfRolls + 1,
                )
            }
        }
    }

#### Mutating the UI state from asynchronous calls

For state changes that require an asynchronous result, launch a Coroutine in the
appropriate `CoroutineScope`. This allows the app to discard the work when the
`CoroutineScope` is canceled. The state holder then writes the result of the
suspend method call into the observable API used to expose the UI state.

For example, consider the `AddEditTaskViewModel` in the
[Architecture sample](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples). When the suspending `saveTask` method saves a task
asynchronously, the [`update`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/update.html) method on the MutableStateFlow propagates the
state change to the UI state.

### Compose State

    @Stable
    interface AddEditTaskUiState {
        val title: String
        val description: String
        val isTaskCompleted: Boolean
        val isLoading: Boolean
        val userMessage: String?
        val isTaskSaved: Boolean
    }

    private class MutableAddEditTaskUiState : AddEditTaskUiState() {
        override var title: String by mutableStateOf("")
        override var description: String by mutableStateOf("")
        override var isTaskCompleted: Boolean by mutableStateOf(false)
        override var isLoading: Boolean by mutableStateOf(false)
        override var userMessage: String? by mutableStateOf<String?>(null)
        override var isTaskSaved: Boolean by mutableStateOf(false)
    }

    class AddEditTaskViewModel(...) : ViewModel() {

       private val _uiState = MutableAddEditTaskUiState()
       val uiState: AddEditTaskUiState = _uiState

       private fun createNewTask() {
            viewModelScope.launch {
                val newTask = Task(uiState.value.title, uiState.value.description)
                try {
                    tasksRepository.saveTask(newTask)
                    // Write data into the UI state.
                    _uiState.isTaskSaved = true
                }
                catch(cancellationException: CancellationException) {
                    throw cancellationException
                }
                catch(exception: Exception) {
                    _uiState.userMessage = getErrorMessage(exception))
                }
            }
        }
    }

### StateFlow

    data class AddEditTaskUiState(
        val title: String = "",
        val description: String = "",
        val isTaskCompleted: Boolean = false,
        val isLoading: Boolean = false,
        val userMessage: String? = null,
        val isTaskSaved: Boolean = false
    )

    class AddEditTaskViewModel(...) : ViewModel() {

       private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(AddEditTaskUiState())
       val uiState: StateFlow<AddEditTaskUiState> = _uiState.asStateFlow()

       private fun createNewTask() {
            viewModelScope.launch {
                val newTask = Task(uiState.value.title, uiState.value.description)
                try {
                    tasksRepository.saveTask(newTask)
                    // Write data into the UI state.
                    _uiState.update {
                        it.copy(isTaskSaved = true)
                    }
                }
                catch(cancellationException: CancellationException) {
                    throw cancellationException
                }
                catch(exception: Exception) {
                    _uiState.update {
                        it.copy(userMessage = getErrorMessage(exception))
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Coroutines launched in the `viewModelScope` of an [AAC](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), run to completion, exceptionally or otherwise. This occurs whether the UI is visible or not, unless the Coroutines are explicitly canceled or the `ViewModel` is cleared. This is typically fine for most requests as they tend to be short lived. Don't use the `viewModelScope` to run requests that last for 5 seconds or more. Instead, enqueue them as deferred or long-running work with WorkManager.

#### Mutating the UI state from background threads

It's preferable to launch Coroutines on the main dispatcher for the production
of UI state---that is, outside the `withContext` block in the code snippets below.
However, if you need to update the UI state in a different background context,
you can do the following:

- Use the [`withContext`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/with-context.html) method to run Coroutines in a different concurrent context.
- When using `MutableStateFlow`, use the [`update`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/update.html) method as usual.
- When using Compose State, use the [`Snapshot.withMutableSnapshot`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/snapshots/Snapshot.Companion#withMutableSnapshot(kotlin.Function0)) method to guarantee atomic updates to State in the concurrent context.

For example, assume that in the `DiceRollViewModel` snippet below,
`SlowRandom.nextInt` is a computationally intensive `suspend` function that
needs to be called from a CPU-bound Coroutine.

### Compose State

    class DiceRollViewModel(
        private val defaultDispatcher: CoroutineScope = Dispatchers.Default
    ) : ViewModel() {

        private val _uiState = MutableDiceUiState()
        val uiState: DiceUiState = _uiState

      // Called from the UI
      fun rollDice() {
            viewModelScope.launch() {
                // Other Coroutines that may be called from the current context
                ...
                withContext(defaultDispatcher) {
                    Snapshot.withMutableSnapshot {
                        _uiState.firstDieValue = SlowRandom.nextInt(from = 1, until = 7)
                        _uiState.secondDieValue = SlowRandom.nextInt(from = 1, until = 7)
                        _uiState.numberOfRolls = _uiState.numberOfRolls + 1
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

### StateFlow

    class DiceRollViewModel(
        private val defaultDispatcher: CoroutineScope = Dispatchers.Default
    ) : ViewModel() {

        private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(DiceUiState())
        val uiState: StateFlow<DiceUiState> = _uiState.asStateFlow()

      // Called from the UI
      fun rollDice() {
            viewModelScope.launch() {
                // Other Coroutines that may be called from the current context
                ...
                withContext(defaultDispatcher) {
                    _uiState.update { currentState ->
                        currentState.copy(
                            firstDieValue = SlowRandom.nextInt(from = 1, until = 7),
                            secondDieValue = SlowRandom.nextInt(from = 1, until = 7),
                            numberOfRolls = currentState.numberOfRolls + 1,
                        )
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If all coroutines launched need to be called from a different context, you can call `viewModelScope.launch(defaultDispatcher){ }` directly.

> [!WARNING]
> **Warning:** Updating Compose state from a non-UI thread without using `Snapshot.withMutableSnapshot{ }` can cause inconsistencies in the state produced.

### Stream APIs as sources of state change

For sources of state change that produce multiple values over time in streams,
aggregating the outputs of all the sources into a cohesive whole is a
straightforward approach to state production.

When using Kotlin Flows, you can achieve this with the [combine](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/combine.html) function.
An example of this can be seen in the ["Now in Android" sample](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) in the
`InterestsViewModel`:

    class InterestsViewModel(
        authorsRepository: AuthorsRepository,
        topicsRepository: TopicsRepository
    ) : ViewModel() {

        val uiState = combine(
            authorsRepository.getAuthorsStream(),
            topicsRepository.getTopicsStream(),
        ) { availableAuthors, availableTopics ->
            InterestsUiState.Interests(
                authors = availableAuthors,
                topics = availableTopics
            )
        }
            .stateIn(
                scope = viewModelScope,
                started = SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5_000),
                initialValue = InterestsUiState.Loading
        )
    }

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** You can use the [`stateIn`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/state-in.html) operator to convert the combined `Flow` into a [`StateFlow`](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) as the observable API for UI state.

Use of the `stateIn` operator to create `StateFlows` gives the UI finer grained
control over the activity of the state production pipeline as it might need to
be active only when the UI is visible.

- Use `SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed` if the pipeline needs to be active only when the UI is visible while collecting the flow in a lifecycle-aware manner.
- Use `SharingStarted.Lazily` if the pipeline needs to be active as long as the user might return to the UI---that is, the UI is on the backstack or in another tab offscreen.

In cases where aggregating stream-based sources of state does not apply, stream
APIs like Kotlin Flows offer a rich set of transformations such as
[merging](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/merge.html?query=fun+%3CT%3E+merge(vararg+flows:+Flow%3CT%3E), [flattening](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/flat-map-latest.html?query=inline+fun+%3CT,+R%3E+Flow%3CT%3E.flatMapLatest(crossinline+transform:+suspend+(T), and so on to help with processing the streams
into UI state.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Key Point:** In most cases, combine is an advisable approach to producing state from stream APIs.

### One-shot and stream APIs as sources of state change

In the case where the state production pipeline depends on both one-shot calls
and streams as sources of state change, streams are the defining constraint.
Therefore, convert the one-shot calls into streams APIs, or pipe their output
into streams and resume processing as described in the streams section above.

With flows, this typically means creating one or more private backing
`MutableStateFlow` instances to propagate state changes. You can also [create
snapshot flows](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/package-summary#snapshotFlow(kotlin.Function0)) from Compose state.

Consider the `TaskDetailViewModel` from the [architecture-samples](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples)
repository. The UI state depends on a stream for the current task (`_task`) and
a one-shot source (`_isTaskDeleted`) that updates when the task is deleted. This
flag is necessary to differentiate between when a task is not found in the
database because of an incorrect ID, and when it is not found because the user
just deleted it:

### Compose State

    class TaskDetailViewModel @Inject constructor(
        private val tasksRepository: TasksRepository,
        savedStateHandle: SavedStateHandle
    ) : ViewModel() {

        private var _isTaskDeleted by mutableStateOf(false)
        private val _task = tasksRepository.getTaskStream(taskId)

        val uiState: StateFlow<TaskDetailUiState> = combine(
            snapshotFlow { _isTaskDeleted },
            _task
        ) { isTaskDeleted, taskAsync ->
            TaskDetailUiState(
                task = taskAsync.data,
                isTaskDeleted = isTaskDeleted
            )
        }
            // Convert the result to the appropriate observable API for the UI
            .stateIn(
                scope = viewModelScope,
                started = SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5_000),
                initialValue = TaskDetailUiState()
            )

        fun deleteTask() = viewModelScope.launch {
            tasksRepository.deleteTask(taskId)
            _isTaskDeleted = true
        }
    }

### StateFlow

    class TaskDetailViewModel @Inject constructor(
        private val tasksRepository: TasksRepository,
        savedStateHandle: SavedStateHandle
    ) : ViewModel() {

        private val _isTaskDeleted = MutableStateFlow(false)
        private val _task = tasksRepository.getTaskStream(taskId)

        val uiState: StateFlow<TaskDetailUiState> = combine(
            _isTaskDeleted,
            _task
        ) { isTaskDeleted, taskAsync ->
            TaskDetailUiState(
                task = taskAsync.data,
                isTaskDeleted = isTaskDeleted
            )
        }
            // Convert the result to the appropriate observable API for the UI
            .stateIn(
                scope = viewModelScope,
                started = SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5_000),
                initialValue = TaskDetailUiState()
            )

        fun deleteTask() = viewModelScope.launch {
            tasksRepository.deleteTask(taskId)
            _isTaskDeleted.update { true }
        }
    }

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Compose `State` is converted to a flow using the [`snapshotFlow`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/package-summary#snapshotFlow(kotlin.Function0)) API.

## Output types in state production pipelines

The choice of the output API for UI state and the nature of its presentation
depend largely on the API your app uses to render the UI, such as Compose.
[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose) is the recommended modern toolkit for building native UI.
Considerations here include the following:

- Reading state in a [lifecycle-aware](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/consuming-flows-safely-in-jetpack-compose-cde014d0d5a3) manner.
- Whether to [expose state in one or multiple fields](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#additional-considerations) from the state holder.

The following table summarizes what APIs to use for your state production
pipeline when using Jetpack Compose:

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| One-shot APIs | `StateFlow` or Compose `State` |
| Stream APIs | `StateFlow` |
| One-shot and stream APIs | `StateFlow` |

## State production pipeline initialization

Initializing state production pipelines involves setting the initial conditions
for the pipeline to run. This might involve providing initial input values
critical to the starting of the pipeline---for example, an `id` for the detail
view of a news article, or starting an asynchronous load.

When possible, initialize the state production pipeline lazily to conserve
system resources. Practically, this often means waiting until there is a
consumer of the output. `Flow` APIs allow for this with the `started` argument
in the [`stateIn`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/state-in.html) method. In the cases where this is inapplicable, define
an [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) `initialize` function to explicitly start the state
production pipeline as shown in the following snippet:

    class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {

        private var initializeCalled = false

        // This function is idempotent provided it is only called from the UI thread.
        @MainThread
        fun initialize() {
            if(initializeCalled) return
            initializeCalled = true

            viewModelScope.launch {
                // seed the state production pipeline
            }
        }
    }

> [!WARNING]
> **Warning:** Don't launch asynchronous operations in the `init` block or constructor of a `ViewModel`. You must avoid launching asynchronous operations as side effects of creating an object because the asynchronous code can read from or write to the object before it is fully initialized. This is also referred to as leaking the object, and it can lead to subtle and hard to diagnose errors. This is particularly important when working with Compose State. When the ViewModel holds Compose State fields, don't launch a Coroutine in the `init` block of the `ViewModel` that updates the Compose State fields; otherwise, an `IllegalStateException` can occur.
