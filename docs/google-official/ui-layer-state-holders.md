The [UI layer guide](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer) discusses unidirectional data flow (UDF) as a means of
producing and managing the UI State for the UI layer.
![Data flows unidirectionally from the data layer to the UI.](https://developer.android.com/static/images/topic/architecture/ui-layer/udf.png) **Figure 1.** Unidirectional data flow.

It also highlights the benefits of delegating UDF management to a special class
called a state holder. You can implement a state holder either through a
`ViewModel` or a plain class. This document takes a closer look at state
holders and the role they play in the UI layer.

At the end of this document, you should have an understanding of how to manage
application state in the UI layer; that is the UI state production pipeline. You
should be able to understand and know the following:

- Understand the types of UI state that exist in the UI layer.
- Understand the types of logic that operate on those UI states in the UI layer.
- Know how to choose the appropriate implementation of a state holder, such as a `ViewModel` or a class.

## Elements of the UI state production pipeline

The UI state and the logic that produces it defines the UI layer.

### UI state

[UI state](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#define-ui-state) is the property that
describes the UI. There are two types of UI state:

- **Screen UI state** is *what* you need to display on the screen. For example, a `NewsUiState` class can contain the news articles and other information needed to render the UI. This state is usually connected with other layers of the hierarchy because it contains app data.
- **UI element state** refers to properties intrinsic to UI elements that influence how they are rendered. A UI element may be shown or hidden and may have a certain font, font size, or font color. In Jetpack Compose, the state is external to the composable, and you can even hoist it out of the immediate vicinity of the composable into the calling composable function or a state holder. An example of this is [`ScaffoldState`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/ScaffoldState) for the [`Scaffold`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/Scaffold.composable#Scaffold(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.material.ScaffoldState,kotlin.Function0,kotlin.Function0,kotlin.Function1,kotlin.Function0,androidx.compose.material.FabPosition,kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.Function1,kotlin.Boolean,androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Shape,androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp,androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color,androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color,androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color,androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color,androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color,kotlin.Function1)) composable.

### Logic

UI state is not a static property, as application data and user events cause UI
state to change over time. Logic determines the specifics of the change,
including what parts of the UI state have changed, why it's changed, and when it
should change.
![Logic produces UI state](https://developer.android.com/static/images/topic/architecture/ui-layer/logic.png) **Figure 2.** Logic as the producer of UI state.

Logic in an application can be either business logic or UI logic:

- **Business logic** is the implementation of product requirements for app data. For example, bookmarking an article in a news reader app when the user taps the button. This logic to save a bookmark to a file or database is usually placed in the domain or data layers. The state holder usually delegates this logic to those layers by calling the methods they expose.
- **UI logic** is related to *how* to display UI state on the screen. For example, obtaining the right search bar hint when the user has selected a category, scrolling to a particular item in a list, or the navigation logic to a particular screen when the user clicks a button.

## Android lifecycle and the types of UI state and logic

The UI layer has two parts: one dependent and the other independent of the UI
lifecycle. This separation determines the data sources available to each part,
and therefore requires different types of UI state and logic.

- **UI lifecycle independent** : This part of the UI layer deals with the data producing layers of the app (data or domain layers) and is defined by business logic. Lifecycle, configuration changes, and `Activity` recreation in the UI may affect if the UI state production pipeline is active, but do not affect the validity of the data produced.
- **UI lifecycle dependent**: This part of the UI layer deals with UI logic, and is directly influenced by lifecycle or configuration changes. These changes directly affect the validity of the sources of data read within it, and as a result its state can only change when its lifecycle is active. Examples of this include runtime permissions and getting configuration dependent resources like localized strings.

The above can be summarized with the table below:

| UI Lifecycle independent | UI Lifecycle dependent |
|---|---|
| Business logic | UI Logic |
| Screen UI state |   |

### The UI state production pipeline

The UI state production pipeline refers to the steps undertaken to produce UI
state. These steps comprise the application of the types of logic defined
earlier, and are completely dependent on the needs of your UI. *Some UIs may
benefit from both UI Lifecycle independent and UI Lifecycle dependent parts of
the pipeline, either, or neither*.

That is, the following permutations of the UI layer pipeline are valid:

- UI state produced and managed by the UI itself. For example, a simple,
  reusable basic counter:

      @Composable
      fun Counter() {
          // The UI state is managed by the UI itself
          var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
          Row {
              Button(onClick = { ++count }) {
                  Text(text = "Increment")
              }
              Button(onClick = { --count }) {
                  Text(text = "Decrement")
              }
          }
      }

- UI logic → UI. For example, showing or hiding a button that allows a user to
  jump to the top of a list.

      @Composable
      fun ContactsList(contacts: List<Contact>) {
          val listState = rememberLazyListState()
          val isAtTopOfList by remember {
              derivedStateOf {
                  listState.firstVisibleItemIndex < 3
              }
          }

          // Create the LazyColumn with the lazyListState
          ...

          // Show or hide the button (UI logic) based on the list scroll position
          AnimatedVisibility(visible = !isAtTopOfList) {
              ScrollToTopButton()
          }
      }

- Business logic → UI. A UI element displaying the current user's photo on the
  screen.

      @Composable
      fun UserProfileScreen(viewModel: UserProfileViewModel = hiltViewModel()) {
          // Read screen UI state from the business logic state holder
          val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()

          // Call on the UserAvatar Composable to display the photo
          UserAvatar(picture = uiState.profilePicture)
      }

- Business logic → UI logic → UI. A UI element that scrolls to display the
  right information on the screen for a given UI state.

      @Composable
      fun ContactsList(viewModel: ContactsViewModel = hiltViewModel()) {
          // Read screen UI state from the business logic state holder
          val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
          val contacts = uiState.contacts
          val deepLinkedContact = uiState.deepLinkedContact

          val listState = rememberLazyListState()

          // Create the LazyColumn with the lazyListState
          ...

          // Perform UI logic that depends on information from business logic
          if (deepLinkedContact != null && contacts.isNotEmpty()) {
              LaunchedEffect(listState, deepLinkedContact, contacts) {
                  val deepLinkedContactIndex = contacts.indexOf(deepLinkedContact)
                  if (deepLinkedContactIndex >= 0) {
                    // Scroll to deep linked item
                    listState.animateScrollToItem(deepLinkedContactIndex)
                  }
              }
          }
      }

In the case where both kinds of logic are applied to the UI state production
pipeline, **business logic must always be applied before UI logic**. Trying to apply
business logic after UI logic would imply that the business logic depends on UI
logic. The following sections cover why this is a problem through an in depth look at
different logic types and their state holders.
![Data flows from the data producing layer to the UI](https://developer.android.com/static/images/topic/architecture/ui-layer/logic-hierarchy.png) **Figure 3.** Application of logic in the UI layer.

## State holders and their responsibilities

The responsibility of a state holder is to store state so the app can read it.
In cases where logic is needed, it acts as an intermediary and provides access
to the data sources that host the required logic. In this way, the state holder
delegates logic to the appropriate data source.

This produces the following benefits:

- **Simple UIs**: The UI just binds its state.
- **Maintainability**: The logic defined in the state holder can be iterated upon without changing the UI itself.
- **Testability**: The UI and its state production logic can be tested independently.
- **Readability**: Readers of the code can clearly see differences between UI presentation code and UI state production code.

Regardless of its size or scope, every UI element has a 1:1 relationship with
its corresponding state holder. Furthermore, a state holder must be able to
accept and process any user action that might result in a UI state change and
must produce the ensuing state change.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** State holders are not strictly necessary. Simple UIs may host their logic inline with their presentation code.

### Types of state holders

Similar to the kinds of UI state and logic, there are two types of state holders
in the UI layer defined by their relationship to the UI lifecycle:

- The business logic state holder.
- The UI logic state holder.

The following sections take a closer look at the types of state holders,
starting with the business logic state holder.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If a UI logic state holder depends on information from the data or domain layers, you should pass that information to it from a business logic state holder. This is because the business logic state holder is longer lived than the UI logic state holder since it is independent of the UI lifecycle.

## Business logic and its state holder

Business logic state holders process user events and transform data from the data or domain
layers to screen UI state. In order to provide an optimal user experience when
considering the Android lifecycle and app configuration changes, state holders
that utilize business logic should have the following properties:

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| Produces UI State | Business logic state holders are responsible for producing the UI state for their UIs. This UI state is often the result of processing user events and reading data from the domain and data layers. |
| Retained through activity recreation | Business logic state holders retain their state and state processing pipelines across `Activity` recreation, helping provide a seamless user experience. In the cases where the state holder is unable to be retained and is recreated (usually after [process death](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/process-lifecycle)), the state holder must be able to easily recreate its last state to ensure a consistent user experience. |
| Possess long lived state | Business logic state holders are often used to manage state for navigation destinations. As a result, they often preserve their state across navigation changes until they are removed from the navigation graph. |
| Is unique to its UI and is not reusable | Business logic state holders typically produce state for a certain app function, for example a `TaskEditViewModel` or a `TaskListViewModel`, and therefore only ever applicable to that app function. The same state holder can support these app functions across different form factors. For example, mobile, TV, and tablet versions of the app may reuse the same business logic state holder. |

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The business logic state holder is typically implemented with a [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel?gclid=CjwKCAjwv-GUBhAzEiwASUMm4jGM5Xw9jQrNGwjdH6dspujLXTiJAfDYLC3bOuur7QFYn1tRnojAKRoCqE0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) instance because `ViewModel` instances support many of the features outlined above, particularly surviving `Activity` recreation.

For example consider the author navigation destination in the ["Now in
Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid)" app:
![The Now in Android app demonstrates how a navigation destination representing a major app function ought to have
its own unique business logic state holder.](https://developer.android.com/static/images/topic/architecture/ui-layer/nia-author.png) **Figure 4.** The Now in Android app.

Acting as the business logic state holder, the `AuthorViewModel` produces the
UI state in this case:

    @HiltViewModel
    class AuthorViewModel @Inject constructor(
        savedStateHandle: SavedStateHandle,
        private val authorsRepository: AuthorsRepository,
        newsRepository: NewsRepository
    ) : ViewModel() {

        val uiState: StateFlow<AuthorScreenUiState> = ...

        // Business logic
        fun followAuthor(followed: Boolean) {
          ...
        }
    }

Notice that the `AuthorViewModel` has the attributes outlined previously:

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| Produces `AuthorScreenUiState` | The `AuthorViewModel` reads data from the `AuthorsRepository` and `NewsRepository` and uses that data to produce `AuthorScreenUiState`. It also applies business logic when the user wants to follow or unfollow an `Author` by delegating to the `AuthorsRepository`. |
| Has access to the data layer | An instance of `AuthorsRepository` and `NewsRepository` are passed to it in its constructor, allowing it to implement the business logic of following an `Author`. |
| Survives `Activity` recreation | Because it is implemented with a [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4uaUBhC8ARIsANUuDjWnr2D2RL5QDLrOFZBl4TQSF7AF4hkuEEtsz1EV3fbPN-6DD4PLH1MaAvF1EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), it will be retained across quick `Activity` recreation. In the case of process death, the [`SavedStateHandle`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel-savedstate) object can be read from to provide the minimum amount of information required to restore the UI state from the data layer. |
| Possesses long lived state | The `ViewModel` is scoped to the navigation graph, therefore unless the author destination is removed from the nav graph, the UI state in the `uiState` `StateFlow` remains in memory. The use of the `StateFlow` also adds the benefit of making the application of the business logic that produces the state lazy because state is only produced if there is a collector of the UI state. |
| Is unique to its UI | The `AuthorViewModel` is only applicable to the author navigation destination and cannot be reused anywhere else. If there is any business logic that is reused across navigation destinations, that business logic must be encapsulated in a data- or domain-layer-scoped component. |

> [!WARNING]
> **Warning:** Don't pass ViewModel instances down to other composable functions. Doing so couples the composable function with the ViewModel type, making it less reusable and harder to test and preview. Also, there would be no clear single source of truth (SSOT) that manages the ViewModel instance. Passing the ViewModel down allows multiple composables to call ViewModel functions and modify its state, making bugs harder to debug. Instead, follow UDF best practices and pass down just the necessary state. Likewise, pass the propagating events up until they reach the ViewModel's composable SSOT. That is the SSOT which handles the event and calls the corresponding ViewModel methods.

### The ViewModel as a business logic state holder

**The benefits of ViewModels** in Android development make them suitable for
providing access to the business logic and preparing the application data for
presentation on the screen. These benefits include the following:

- Operations triggered by ViewModels survive configuration changes.
- Integration with [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation):
  - Navigation caches ViewModels while the screen is on the back stack. This is important to have your previously loaded data instantly available when you return to your destination. This is something more difficult to do with a state holder that follows the lifecycle of the composable screen.
  - The ViewModel is also cleared when the destination is popped off the back stack, ensuring that your state is automatically cleaned up. This is different from listening for the composable disposal that can happen for multiple reasons such as going to a new screen, due to a configuration change, or other reasons.
- Integration with other Jetpack libraries such as [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack#compose).

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If `ViewModel` benefits don't apply to your use case or you do things in a different way you can move ViewModel's responsibilities into plain state holder classes.

## UI logic and its state holder

UI logic is logic that operates on data that the UI itself provides. This may be
on UI elements' state, or on UI data sources like the permissions API or
[`Resources`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Resources). State holders that utilize UI logic typically have the
following properties:

- **Produces UI state and manages UI elements state**.
- **Does not survive `Activity` recreation** : State holders that are hosted in UI logic are often dependent on data sources from the UI itself, and attempting to retain this information across configuration changes more often than not causes a memory leak. If state holders need data to persist across configuration changes, they need to delegate to another component better suited to surviving `Activity` recreation. In Jetpack Compose for example, Composable UI element states created with `remembered` functions often delegate to `rememberSaveable` to preserve state across `Activity` recreation. Examples of such functions include `rememberScaffoldState()` and `rememberLazyListState()`.
- **Has references to UI scoped sources of data**: Sources of data like lifecycle APIs and Resources can safely be referenced and read as the UI logic state holder has the same lifecycle as the UI.
- **Is reusable across multiple UIs**: Different instances of the same UI logic state holder may be reused in different parts of the app. For example, a state holder for managing user input events for a chip group may be used on a search page for filter chips, and also for the "to" field for receivers of an email.

The UI logic state holder is typically implemented with a plain class. This is
because the UI itself is responsible for the creation of the UI logic state
holder and the UI logic state holder has the same lifecycle as the UI itself.
In Jetpack Compose for example, the state holder is part of the Composition and
follows the Composition's lifecycle.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Plain class state holders are used when UI logic is complex enough to be moved out of the UI. Otherwise, UI logic can be implemented inline in the UI.

The preceding can be illustrated in the following example in the
[Now in Android sample](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid):
![Now in Android uses a plain class state holder to manage UI logic](https://developer.android.com/static/images/topic/architecture/ui-layer/nia-home.png) **Figure 5.** The Now in Android sample app.

The Now in Android sample shows either a bottom app bar or a navigation rail for
its navigation depending on the device's screen size. Smaller screens use the
bottom app bar, and larger screens the navigation rail.

Since the logic for deciding the appropriate navigation UI element used in the
`NiaApp` composable function doesn't depend on business logic, it can be managed
by a plain class state holder called `NiaAppState`:

    @Stable
    class NiaAppState(
        val navController: NavHostController,
        val windowSizeClass: WindowSizeClass
    ) {

        // UI logic
        val shouldShowBottomBar: Boolean
            get() = windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass == WindowWidthSizeClass.Compact ||
                windowSizeClass.heightSizeClass == WindowHeightSizeClass.Compact

        // UI logic
        val shouldShowNavRail: Boolean
            get() = !shouldShowBottomBar

       // UI State
        val currentDestination: NavDestination?
            @Composable get() = navController
                .currentBackStackEntryAsState().value?.destination

        // UI logic
        fun navigate(destination: NiaNavigationDestination, route: String? = null) { /* ... */ }

         /* ... */
    }

In the preceding example, the following details regarding `NiaAppState` are
notable:

- **Does not survive `Activity` recreation** : `NiaAppState` is `remembered` in the Composition by creating it with a Composable function `rememberNiaAppState` following Compose naming conventions. After the `Activity` is recreated, the prior instance is lost and a new instance is created with all its dependencies passed in, appropriate for the new configuration of the recreated `Activity`. These dependencies may be new or restored from the previous configuration. For example, `rememberNavController()` is used in the `NiaAppState` constructor and it delegates to `rememberSaveable` to preserve state across `Activity` recreation.
- **Has references to UI scoped sources of data** : References to the `navigationController`, `Resources` and other similar lifecycle scoped types can be safely held in `NiaAppState` as they share the same lifecycle scope.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Plain state holder classes are recommended for reusable pieces of UI like search bars or chip groups. You shouldn't use ViewModels in this case because they are best used for managing state for navigation destinations and access to business logic.

## Choose between a ViewModel and plain class for a state holder

From the preceding sections, choosing between a `ViewModel` and a plain class
state holder comes down to the logic applied to the UI state and the sources of
data the logic operates on.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Most applications elect to perform UI logic inline in the UI itself that could otherwise be placed in plain class state holders. This is fine for simple cases, but for other situations, you can improve readability by pulling the logic out to a plain class state holder.

In summary, the following diagram shows the position of state holders in the UI
State production pipeline:
![Data flows from the data producing layer to the UI layer](https://developer.android.com/static/images/topic/architecture/ui-layer/stateholder-hierarchy.png) **Figure 6.** State holders in the UI State production pipeline. Arrows mean data flow.

**Ultimately, you should produce UI state using state holders closest
to where it is consumed** . Less formally, you should hold state as low as
possible while maintaining proper ownership. If you need access to business
logic and need the UI state to persist as long as a screen may be navigated to,
even across `Activity` recreation, a [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4uaUBhC8ARIsANUuDjWnr2D2RL5QDLrOFZBl4TQSF7AF4hkuEEtsz1EV3fbPN-6DD4PLH1MaAvF1EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) is a great choice for
your business logic state holder implementation. For shorter-lived UI state and
UI logic, a plain class whose lifecycle is dependent solely on the UI should
suffice.

## State holders are compoundable

State holders can depend on other state holders as long as the dependencies have
an equal or shorter lifetime. Examples of this are:

- a UI logic state holder can depend on another UI logic state holder.
- a screen level state holder can depend on a UI logic state holder.

The following code snippet shows how [Compose's `DrawerState`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/DrawerState) depends on
another internal state holder, [`SwipeableState`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/SwipeableState), and how an app's UI logic
state holder could depend on `DrawerState`:

    @Stable
    class DrawerState(/* ... */) {
      internal val swipeableState = SwipeableState(/* ... */)
      // ...
    }

    @Stable
    class MyAppState(
      private val drawerState: DrawerState,
      private val navController: NavHostController
    ) { /* ... */ }

    @Composable
    fun rememberMyAppState(
      drawerState: DrawerState = rememberDrawerState(DrawerValue.Closed),
      navController: NavHostController = rememberNavController()
    ): MyAppState = remember(drawerState, navController) {
      MyAppState(drawerState, navController)
    }

> [!CAUTION]
> **Caution:** Given that screen level state holders manage the business logic complexity of a screen or part of it, it wouldn't make sense a screen level state holder depends on another screen level state holder. If you're in this scenario, reconsider your screens and state holders and ensure that's what you need.

An example of a dependency that outlives a state holder would be a UI logic
state holder depending on a screen level state holder. That would decrease the
reusability of the shorter-lived state holder and gives it access to more logic
and state than it actually needs.

If the shorter-lived state holder needs certain information from a higher-scoped
state holder, pass only the information it needs as a parameter instead of
passing the state holder instance. For example, in the following code snippet,
the UI logic state holder class receives just what it needs as parameters
from the ViewModel, instead of passing the whole ViewModel instance as a
dependency.

    class MyScreenViewModel(/* ... */) {
      val uiState: StateFlow<MyScreenUiState> = /* ... */
      fun doSomething() { /* ... */ }
      fun doAnotherThing() { /* ... */ }
      // ...
    }

    @Stable
    class MyScreenState(
      // DO NOT pass a ViewModel instance to a plain state holder class
      // private val viewModel: MyScreenViewModel,

      // Instead, pass only what it needs as a dependency
      private val someState: StateFlow<SomeState>,
      private val doSomething: () -> Unit,

      // Other UI-scoped types
      private val scaffoldState: ScaffoldState
    ) {
      /* ... */
    }

    @Composable
    fun rememberMyScreenState(
      someState: StateFlow<SomeState>,
      doSomething: () -> Unit,
      scaffoldState: ScaffoldState = rememberScaffoldState()
    ): MyScreenState = remember(someState, doSomething, scaffoldState) {
      MyScreenState(someState, doSomething, scaffoldState)
    }

    @Composable
    fun MyScreen(
      modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
      viewModel: MyScreenViewModel = viewModel(),
      state: MyScreenState = rememberMyScreenState(
        someState = viewModel.uiState.map { it.toSomeState() },
        doSomething = viewModel::doSomething
      ),
      // ...
    ) {
      /* ... */
    }

The following diagram represents the dependencies between the UI and different
state holders of the previous code snippet:
