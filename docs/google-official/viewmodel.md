<br />

The [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) class is a [business logic or screen level state
holder](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/stateholders). It exposes state to the UI and encapsulates related business logic.
Its principal advantage is that it caches state and persists it through
configuration changes. This means that your UI doesn't have to fetch data again
when navigating between activities, or following configuration changes, such as
when rotating the screen.

> [!NOTE]
> **Objective:** This guide explains the basics of ViewModels, how they fit into [Modern Android Development](https://developer.android.com/modern-android-development), and how you can implement them in your app.

For more information on state holders, see the [state holders](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/stateholders) guidance.
Similarly, for more information on the UI layer generally, see the [UI layer](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer)
guidance.

## ViewModel benefits

The alternative to a ViewModel is a plain class that holds the data you display
in your UI. This can become a problem when navigating between activities or
Navigation destinations. Doing so destroys that data if you don't store it
using the [saved instance state mechanism](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/saving-states#onsaveinstancestate). ViewModel provides a convenient
API for data persistence that resolves this issue.

Alternatively, for pure state holders, Compose offers `retain` capabilities that
allow plain classes to survive configuration changes without the full
infrastructure of a ViewModel. While both mechanisms help with state retention,
it is generally safer to provide a ViewModel to a retained instance rather than
the other way around, as their lifecycles and cleanup behaviors differ.

The key benefits of the ViewModel class are essentially two:

- It lets you persist UI state.
- It provides access to business logic.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** ViewModel fully supports integration with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose) and other key Jetpack libraries such as [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) and [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation).

### Persistence

ViewModel allows persistence through both the state that a ViewModel holds, and
the operations that a ViewModel triggers. This caching means that you don't have
to fetch data again through common configuration changes, such as a screen
rotation.

#### Scope

When you instantiate a ViewModel, you pass it an object that implements the
[`ViewModelStoreOwner`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModelStoreOwner) interface. This may be a Navigation destination,
Navigation graph, activity, or any other type that implements the
interface. You also can scope a ViewModel directly to a composable using
the [`rememberViewModelStoreOwner`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/viewmodel/compose/rememberViewModelStoreOwner.composable) API.
Your ViewModel is then scoped to the [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/Lifecycle) of the
`ViewModelStoreOwner`. It remains in memory until its `ViewModelStoreOwner`
goes away permanently (like when the composable owner exits the Composition).

A range of classes are either direct or indirect subclasses of the
`ViewModelStoreOwner` interface. The direct subclasses are
[`ComponentActivity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/activity/ComponentActivity) and [`NavBackStackEntry`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/navigation/NavBackStackEntry).
For a full list of indirect subclasses, see the
[`ViewModelStoreOwner` reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModelStoreOwner). To scope ViewModels to individual items
in a `LazyList` or `Pager`, use `rememberViewModelStoreProvider()` to hoist
the owner management to the parent.

When the host activity undergoes a configuration change,
asynchronous work continues
in the ViewModel, whether it is scoped to the activity or to specific
composable. This is the key to persistence.

For more information, see the [ViewModel lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel#lifecycle) section that follows,
[ViewModel Scoping APIs](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel/viewmodel-apis#vm-api-composable),
and the guide on [state hoisting](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state-hoisting#viewmodels-as-state-owner) for Jetpack Compose.

#### SavedStateHandle

[SavedStateHandle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel/viewmodel-savedstate) lets you persist data not just through configuration
changes, but across process death. That is, it lets you keep the UI
state intact even when the user closes the app and opens it at a later time.

For more information about saving UI state,
see [Save UI state in Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/state-saving).

### Access to business logic

Even though the vast majority of [business logic](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/stateholders#business-logic) is present in the data
layer, the UI layer can also contain business logic. This can be the case when
combining data from multiple repositories to create the screen UI state, or when
a particular type of data doesn't require a data layer.

ViewModel is the right place to handle business logic in the UI layer. The
ViewModel is also in charge of handling events and delegating them to other
layers of the hierarchy when business logic needs to be applied to modify
application data.

## Implement a ViewModel

The following is an example implementation of a ViewModel for a screen that
allows the user to roll dice.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** In this example, the responsibility of acquiring and holding the list of users sits with the ViewModel, not an Activity directly.

    data class DiceUiState(
        val firstDieValue: Int? = null,
        val secondDieValue: Int? = null,
        val numberOfRolls: Int = 0,
    )

    class DiceRollViewModel : ViewModel() {

        // Expose screen UI state
        private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(DiceUiState())
        val uiState: StateFlow<DiceUiState> = _uiState.asStateFlow()

        // Handle business logic
        fun rollDice() {
            _uiState.update { currentState ->
                currentState.copy(
                    firstDieValue = Random.nextInt(from = 1, until = 7),
                    secondDieValue = Random.nextInt(from = 1, until = 7),
                    numberOfRolls = currentState.numberOfRolls + 1,
                )
            }
        }
    }

You can then access the ViewModel from a screen-level composable as follows:

    import androidx.lifecycle.viewmodel.compose.viewModel

    // Use the 'viewModel()' function from the lifecycle-viewmodel-compose artifact
    @Composable
    fun DiceRollScreen(
        viewModel: DiceRollViewModel = viewModel()
    ) {
        val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
        // Update UI elements
    }

### Use coroutines with ViewModel

`ViewModel` includes support for Kotlin coroutines. It is able to persist
asynchronous work in the same manner as it persists UI state.

For more information, see [Use Kotlin coroutines with Android Architecture
Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines).

## The lifecycle of a ViewModel

The lifecycle of a [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) is tied directly to its scope. A `ViewModel`
remains in memory until the [`ViewModelStoreOwner`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModelStoreOwner) to which it is scoped
disappears. This may occur in the following contexts:

- In the case of an activity, when it finishes.
- In the case of a Navigation entry, when it's removed from the back stack.
- In the case of a composable, when it exits the Composition. You can use `rememberViewModelStoreOwner` to scope a ViewModel directly to an arbitrary part of your UI (like a `Pager` or `LazyList`).

This makes ViewModels a great solution for storing data that survives
configuration changes.

Figure 1 illustrates the various lifecycle states of an activity as it undergoes
a rotation and then is finished. The illustration also shows the lifetime of the
[`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) next to the associated activity lifecycle. This particular
diagram illustrates the states of an activity.
![Illustrates the lifecycle of a ViewModel as an activity changes state.](https://developer.android.com/static/images/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel-lifecycle.png) **Figure 1.** Lifecycle states of an activity and a ViewModel.

You usually request a [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) the first time the system calls an
activity object's [`onCreate()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)) method. The system may call
[`onCreate()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)) several times throughout the existence of an activity, such
as when a device screen is rotated. The [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) exists from when you
first request a [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) until the activity is finished and destroyed.

### Clearing ViewModel dependencies

The ViewModel calls the [`onCleared`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel#onCleared()) method when the `ViewModelStoreOwner`
destroys it in the course of its lifecycle. This allows you to clean up any work
or dependencies that follow the ViewModel's lifecycle.

The following example shows an alternative to [`viewModelScope`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#viewmodelscope).
`viewModelScope` is a built-in [`CoroutineScope`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-coroutine-scope/) that
automatically follows the ViewModel's lifecycle. The ViewModel uses it to
trigger business-related operations. If you want to use a custom scope instead
of `viewModelScope` for [easier testing](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines/test), the ViewModel can receive a
`CoroutineScope` as a dependency in its constructor. When the
`ViewModelStoreOwner` clears the ViewModel at the end of its lifecycle, the
ViewModel also cancels the `CoroutineScope`.

    class MyViewModel(
        private val coroutineScope: CoroutineScope =
            CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Main.immediate)
    ) : ViewModel() {

        // Other ViewModel logic ...

        override fun onCleared() {
            coroutineScope.cancel()
        }
    }

From lifecycle [version 2.5](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle#version_25_2) and above,
you can pass one or more `Closeable`
objects to the ViewModel's constructor that automatically closes when the
ViewModel instance is cleared.

    class CloseableCoroutineScope(
        context: CoroutineContext = SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Main.immediate
    ) : Closeable, CoroutineScope {
        override val coroutineContext: CoroutineContext = context
        override fun close() {
            coroutineContext.cancel()
       }
    }

    class MyViewModel(
        private val coroutineScope: CoroutineScope = CloseableCoroutineScope()
    ) : ViewModel(coroutineScope) {
        // Other ViewModel logic ...
    }

## Best practices

The following are several key best practices you should follow when implementing
ViewModel:

- Because of [their scoping](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel#lifecycle), use ViewModels as implementation details of a screen level state holder. Don't use them as state holders of reusable UI components such as chip groups or forms. Otherwise, you'd get the same ViewModel instance in different usages of the same UI component under the same ViewModelStoreOwner unless you use an explicit view model key per chip.
- ViewModels shouldn't know about the UI implementation details. Keep the names of the methods the ViewModel API exposes and those of the UI state fields as generic as possible. In this way, your ViewModel can accommodate any type of UI: a mobile phone, foldable, tablet, or even a Chromebook!
- As they can potentially live longer than the `ViewModelStoreOwner`, ViewModels shouldn't hold any references of lifecycle-related APIs such as the `Context` or `Resources` to prevent memory leaks.
- Don't pass ViewModels to other classes, functions or other UI components. Because the platform manages them, you should keep them as close to it as you can---close to your Activity, screen level composable function, or Navigation destination. This prevents lower level components from accessing more data and logic than they need.

## Further information

As your data grows more complex, you might choose to have a separate class just
to load the data. The purpose of [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) is to encapsulate the data for
a UI controller to let the data survive configuration changes. For information
about how to load, persist, and manage data across configuration changes, see
[Saved UI States](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/saving-states).

The [Guide to Android App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide#fetching_data) suggests building a repository class
to handle these functions.
